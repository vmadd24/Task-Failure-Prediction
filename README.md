# Task Failure Prediction

## Overview

📊 This project focuses on predicting task failures in data center systems using historical data. It applies machine learning techniques, data preprocessing, and feature engineering to create predictive models that identify when a task is likely to fail. The models are trained using a classification approach to assess and predict task outcomes, providing early insights into potential issues in task execution.
